## Introduction
Welcome to Kibeth’s Scrapbook. Using HTML, CSS, and JS I created a scrapbook web site. It includes adorable images of Kibeth and her humans doing things she loves. I created this as a scrapbook without using a digital scrapbooking service. I created a book layout that the user can page through to see Kibeth’s scrapbook. This is an ongoing project with content being added and an incomplete design.

## Motivation
I had the idea to create a scrapbook when my sister got her new dog to document . I couldn’t find anything similar to what I was envisioning, I found mostly tools to upload images and content to create a scrapbook. I wanted to maintain control of the images, image quality, and text.
